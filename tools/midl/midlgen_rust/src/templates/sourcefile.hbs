{{!
For MIDL tracing, the Rust bindings are assigned a bindings enum of 6. See
fidl-trace/trace_impl.cc, enum LogContext for more context.

This constant will be unused in a build that has MIDL tracing disabled,
since this constant is used only within trace_duration! macros that will
expand to no-ops. However, the constant needs to be present, since the
constant is evaluated before the macro expansion.

The constant starts with an underscore to avoid clashing with FIDL
declarations, which are not allowed to start with underscores.
