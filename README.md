## 👋 Welcome

MeshX is the foundation for the future of business software. It provides a declarative approach to create your cozy digital workplace. It can replace many of the siloed business tools you use and instead provide seamless, interconnected ecosystem of tools. 

- Connected data with **multiple database** connectors available
- **P2P sharing** without any dependency on central servers
- Consistent view on your work using the [MeshX App][app-link]
- Automations using a **low-code** workflow editor
- **Declarative** API (similar to kubernetes but with a different purpose)
- Highly **extensible** with code or without
- Easy start in the cloud with [MeshX Cloud][cloud-link]
