# Software Delivery README

## Overview

The Software Delivery (SWD) stack is responsible for all updates of runnable
software on a MeshX workspace, including system updates and individual package
updates.

This document serves as a jumping-off point for the SWD codebase, and a
contribution guide.

Before starting, you may wish to read some [documentation](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/packages/package) on MeshX software packaging, or the [long term SWD goals](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/governance/rfcs/0133_swd_goals).

### FAQs
