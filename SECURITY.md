# MeshX Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the MeshX projects, we'd love to hear from you. We will take
all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and
release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

The best way to report a security bug is to email a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g.
reproduction steps, version) to [security@meshx.co](mailto:security@meshx.co).

Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.
