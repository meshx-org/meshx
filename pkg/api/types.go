// TypeMeta describes an individual object in an API response or request
// with strings representing the type of the object and its API schema version.
// Structures that are versioned or persisted should inline TypeMeta.
type TypeMeta struct {
	// APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
	// Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
	// may reject unrecognized values.
	APIVersion string `json:"apiVersion,omitempty"`

	// Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
	// Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`
}

// ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
// users must create.
type ObjectMeta struct {
	// Name is unique within a namespace.  Name is required when creating resources, although
	// some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name
	// automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
	// definition.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// GenerateName indicates that the name should be made unique by the server prior to persisting
	// it. A non-empty value for the field indicates the name will be made unique (and the name
	// returned to the client will be different than the name passed). The value of this field will
	// be combined with a unique suffix on the server if the Name field has not been provided.
	// The provided value must be valid within the rules for Name, and may be truncated by the length
	// of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
	//
	// If this field is specified, and Name is not present, the server will NOT return a 409 if the
	// generated name exists - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
	// ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
	// should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
	GenerateName string `json:"generateName,omitempty"`

	// Namespace defines the space within which name must be unique. An empty namespace is
	// equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.
	// Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for
	// those objects will be empty.
	Namespace string `json:"namespace,omitempty"`

	// SelfLink is a URL representing this object.
	SelfLink string `json:"selfLink,omitempty"`

	// UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by
	// the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT
	// operations.
	// UID types.UID `json:"uid,omitempty"`

	// An opaque value that represents the version of this resource. May be used for optimistic
	// concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources.
	// Clients must treat these values as opaque and values may only be valid for a particular
	// resource or set of resources. Only servers will generate resource versions.
	ResourceVersion string `json:"resourceVersion,omitempty"`

	// CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was
	// created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations.
	// Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
	// CreationTimestamp util.Time `json:"creationTimestamp,omitempty"`

	// DeletionTimestamp is the time after which this resource will be deleted. This
	// field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
	// directly settable by a client. The resource will be deleted (no longer visible from
	// resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this
	// value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened
	// or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that
	// a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
	// signal to the containers in the pod. Once the resource is deleted in the API, the Kubelet
	// will send a hard termination signal to the container.
	// DeletionTimestamp *util.Time `json:"deletionTimestamp,omitempty"`

	// Labels are key value pairs that may be used to scope and select individual resources.
	// Label keys are of the form:
	//     label-key ::= prefixed-name | name
	//     prefixed-name ::= prefix '/' name
	//     prefix ::= DNS_SUBDOMAIN
	//     name ::= DNS_LABEL
	// The prefix is optional.  If the prefix is not specified, the key is assumed to be private
	// to the user.  Other system components that wish to use labels must specify a prefix.  The
	// "kubernetes.io/" prefix is reserved for use by kubernetes components.
	// TODO: replace map[string]string with labels.LabelSet type
	Labels map[string]string `json:"labels,omitempty"`

	// Annotations are unstructured key value data stored with a resource that may be set by
	// external tooling. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying
	// objects.  Annotation keys have the same formatting restrictions as Label keys. See the
	// comments on Labels for details.
	Annotations map[string]string `json:"annotations,omitempty"`
